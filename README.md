Builds some AURs and my libfprint package for my laptop, pushing the diff to [xerootg.github.io](xerootg.github.io)

Saves me time building AURs every time someone pushes.

Use these packages by adding this to your `pacman.conf`:
```ini
[custom]
Server = https://xerootg.github.io/archlinux
SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
```
